# Problem
Publishing data on the web in a de-centralised manner is the grand vision of the Semantic Web. However, decentralisation comes with its problems. Just putting data files on your web server and creating a landing page to describe this data, just goes a short way.

Crawlers can discover links and can download the files automatically, but have no understanding of the context, publisher, version or other metadata of the files, making its usage limited. 

# Primary solution
The TI tools will primarily deliver:

* a template engine to create customizable landing pages for data (based on velocity)
* inclusion of machine-readable metadata in JSON-LD in the <meta><script> part of the landing page to allow automatic processing of discovery, download and machine understanding
* notification of data releases to the DBpedia Databus 

# Total Interoperability
The tool is supposed to provide *Total Interoperability*, whenever data is published. We
