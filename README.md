Aligning Data and Software Lifecycle with Maven

# Problem
Publishing data on the web in a de-centralised manner is the grand vision of the Semantic Web. However, decentralisation comes with its problems. Putting data files on your web server and creating a landing page to describe this data, just goes a short way. Humans can read the landing page and use the right-click save-as to download the files. Crawlers can discover links and can download the files automatically, but have no understanding of the context, publisher, version or other metadata of the files, making its usage limited. 

# Solution
With the databus-maven-plugin you are able to manage and release your data like software. The databus-maven-plugin will help you in producing good metadata and will analyse youur data files for errors as well as generate statistics and finally sign the files with your private key, so all downloaders can verify its integrity. 
Once you publish your data on your own web server, you can ping the databus to collect the metadata and index your data release. This has many advantages for you as a data publisher:
1. your data can be found more easily and trusted due to your signature
2. the databus will push your metadata ownwards to other metadata repositories, so you are even better indexed
3. Databus tools and services from the community will run on your data providing demos and enrichement, so you can benefit from the power of the DBpedia dev community
4. You can browse and setup additional features on the databus
 
# Storage and Tools
 Note that the databus as well as this tool is still in early beta, in order to assess any needs and wishes, we prepared this form to apply as a beta tester:

# How to use this repo

## How to publish data

The repo provides two assets:
1. the Databus Maven Plugin to build your data releases with Maven
2. A template maven project that you can download and adjust
Furthermore, the repo also contains the configuration of the DBpedia Core Releases for you to look at and adapt.  

### Setup
1. Dowload the maven project template (
TODO, at the moment we only have the DBpedia ones

2. Adjust the information in the pom.xml
explain ArtifactID, content, format and compressionvariant

3. add your webid and private key
```
TODO where
```

4. copy your data files under `src/main/resources`


### Lifecycles of the plugin
The instruction here follow the maven lifecycle for releasing software (https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#Lifecycle_Reference), the databus-maven-plugin implements the parts that are necessary to adjust the software lifecycle to the data lifecycle.
In particular the follwoing phases are adjusted.

#### Validate
The plugin checks whether you entered all information correctly, cf. https://github.com/dbpedia/data-release-tool-ti/blob/master/databusmavenplugin/src/main/scala/org/dbepdia/databus/Validate.scala
Version number x.y.z, etc. 
`mvn databus:validate`

```
<execution>
	<id>validate</id>
	<phase>validate</phase>
	<goals>
		<goal>validate</goal>
	</goals>
</execution>
```


#### Generate Resources, Goal analysis
`mvn databus:analysis`

```
<execution>
	<id>analysis</id>
	<phase>process-resources</phase>
	<goals>
		<goal>analysis</goal>
	</goals>
</execution>
```

The plugin will analyse each file that you put under src/main/resourcs to:
1. assess compression used
2. assess format of data
3. assess size
4. parse and validate RDF
5. generate statistics for the links
6. create md5checksum
7. create signature 
cf. https://github.com/dbpedia/data-release-tool-ti/blob/master/databusmavenplugin/src/main/scala/org/dbepdia/databus/FileAnalysis.scala

For each file the plugin will create a local dataid file, i.e. if your file is xxx.ttl.bz2 the FileAnalysis will create xxx.ttl.bz2.data.ttl

#### prepare-package
generate one dataid file for each artifactid out of the local dataid files

#### Deploy, Goal deploy-local
TODO: decide whether this is one goal with different configs or several goals and only one is called, eg. `mvn databus:ckan`
`mvn databus:deploy-local`
This step needs to be adapted by you the most as it depends on where you will host the files, here are some options:

* if you host the data files on the same server as you run maven, you can copy the resources to `/var/www`
* if you run remote, you can upload via ssh or sftp
* many other methods exist

#### Deploy, Goal databus-deploy
`mvn databus:databus-deploy`

Announces the uris of the main dataid for each artifact id to the databus for indexing.
